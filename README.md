# Sorting-Visualization
The Sorting Visualization website is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to visually demonstrate the various sorting algorithms. Powered by JavaScript and frontend technologies, it provides an engaging way for users to understand and learn how different sorting techniques work.
Upon accessing the website, users are presented with a clean and intuitive user interface. They can choose from a selection of popular sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, among others. Each algorithm is represented by a clickable button or dropdown menu for easy selection.
Once an algorithm is chosen the website then displays a visually appealing representation of the initial array. As the sorting process commences, the website dynamically updates the display, showcasing the step-by-step progress of the chosen algorithm
The visualization includes animations and transitions that highlight the comparisons, swaps, and movements of the array elements. The user can control the speed of the visualization to suit their preference, allowing them to observe the sorting process in real-time or at a slower pace for better understanding.
